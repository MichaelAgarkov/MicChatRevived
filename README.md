# MicChat Revived Edition
A revived version of my old client/server chat program made in PascalABC.NET back in April 2020.

If you want to make your own version of this program, the server is `Server.pas`, and the client is `Client.pas`. Everything else is related to the cool launcher, you probably don't want to mess with it, because it's complicated.

I recommend using PascalABC.NET version 3.4.2 build 2050, because it's the version I use, and the version this program is compiled in. You can get it here: https://tinyurl.com/PascalABCNET
