# MicChat Revived Edition
A revived version of my old client/server chat program made in PascalABC.NET back in April 2020.

It's distributed under the BSD 4-Clause License, so you can make your modifications to the program! (Just follow the EULA and don't break it)

I recommend using PascalABC.NET version 3.4.2 build 2050, because it's the version I use, and the version this program is compiled in. You can get it here: https://tinyurl.com/PascalABCNET
