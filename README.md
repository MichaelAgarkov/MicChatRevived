# MicChat Revived Edition
A revived version of my old client/server chat program made in PascalABC.NET back in April 2020.

If you want to make your own version of this program, the server is `Server.pas`, and the client is `Client.pas`. Everything else is related to the cool launcher, you probably don't want to mess with it, because it is very complicated.
